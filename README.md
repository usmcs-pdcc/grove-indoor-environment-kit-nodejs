Grove Indoor Environment Kit - NodeJS
=====================================

Prepare Intel Edison Arduino* board for development
--------------------------------------------------
1. Connect Grove Base Shield into Intel Edison Arduino* board.

2. Connect AC power adapter to Intel Edison. 

3. Connect MicroUSB cable from the first port to PC. 

4. Use Intel Edison installer to set device name, password and WiFi connection. 

5. Intel XDK will be your main IDE for this activity. By using Intel XDK, discover and connect your Edison board. 

A. Moisture Sensor: 01-moisture
-------------------------------
- Connect moisture sensor to A0. 

- Upload project into Edison. Click Upload button. This might take minutes due to WiFi network connection and resolve dependencies activity by the system.

- Click run button to run your project. 

B. Button: 02-button
-------------------- 
- Connect button to D2. 

- Upload project into Edison. Click Upload button. This might take minutes due to WiFi network connection and resolve dependencies activity by the system.

- Click run button to run your project. 

C. UV sensor: 03-uv
------------------- 
- Connect uv sensor to A3. UV sensor is used to detect the intensity of UV (ultravoilet) radiation. 

- Upload project into Edison. Click Upload button. This might take minutes due to WiFi network connection and resolve dependencies activity by the system.

- Click run button to run your project. 

D. Light sensor: 04-light
-------------------------
- Connect light sensor to A2. Light sensor is used to detect the intensity of light in the environment.

- Upload project into Edison. Click Upload button. This might take minutes due to WiFi network connection and resolve dependencies activity by the system.

- Click run button to run your project. 

E. Buzzer: 05-buzzer
-------------------- 
- Connect buzzer to D2. 

- Upload project into Edison. Click Upload button. This might take minutes due to WiFi network connection and resolve dependencies activity by the system.

- Click run button to run your project.

F. 06 Temperature&Humidity: 06-temperature&humidity
---------------------------------------------------
- Connect temperature & humidity sensor to I2C. 

- Upload project into Edison. Click Upload button. This might take minutes due to WiFi network connection and resolve dependencies activity by the system. Kindly note that the code uses johnny-five library. 

- Click run button to run your project. 

G. Servo: 07-servo
------------------
- Install servo horns on servo engine. Then connect servo to D6. 

- Upload project into Edison. Click Upload button. This might take minutes due to WiFi network connection and resolve dependencies activity by the system.

- Click run button to run your project.
